Invoice Information: \\n \\nThe contractor shall utilize the electronic invoicing upon delivery of supplies indicated herein.  Invoice may be \\nsubmitted not more than one every two weeks.  Invoices must be submitted electronically using Wide Area Work \\nFlow (WAWF) – Receipt and Acceptance.  The contractor shall self-register at the web site: https://wawf.eb.mil.  \\nContractor training is available on the Internet at https://wawftraining.eb.mil. \\n \\nAdditional support can be accessed by calling the NAVY WAWF Assistance Line: 1-877-251-9293. \\n \\nSee clause 252.232-7006 for WAWF table. \\n \\n4.  Inspection Level: \\n \\nQA 4   7 days inspection \\n \\n5.  Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS): \\n \\nEffective 14 August 2017, NCACS credentials will no longer be accepted for base access.  Any new contractor, \\nvendor or supplier requesting base access will be required to obtain a Defense Biometric Identification System \\n(DBIDS) credential.  NCACS credentials will no longer be issued.  Only DBIDS credentials will be issued to ALL \\ncontractors, vendors and suppliers seeking base access AFTER 30 June 2017.  Defense Biometric Identification \\nSystem (DBIDS) increases installation security and communications by receiving frequent database updates on \\nchanges to personnel/credential status, law enforcement warrants, lost/stolen cards, and force protection conditions.  \\nThe system provides continuous vetting anytime the DBIDS card is scanned at an installation entry point.   \\n \\nIf you currently have a Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) card, the following is required to get a \\nDBIDS credential: \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Present your NCACS Card and a completed copy of the SECNAV FORM 5512/1 to the base Visitor \\n\\nControl Center (VCC) representative. \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  The VCC will pull up your information in the computer, ensuring all information is current and correct. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Once your information is validated, a temporary DBIDS credential is provided. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Your temporary credential will have an expiration date, prior to which you will need to obtain your \\n\\npermanent DBIDS credential (~ 180 days). \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  For each additional U.S. Navy installation to which you need access, the first time you visit you only need \\n\\nto bring your DBIDS credential and statement of purpose for base access when arriving at the Visitor Control \\nCenter. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cSPMYM224Q0752 \\n \\nPage 4 of 73 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  The representative will enter base access authorization and then you may proceed to work. \\n\\n \\nIf you do NOT have an NCACS Card, the following is required to obtain a DBIDS credential: \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Present a letter or official document from any government sponsoring organization that provides the \\n\\npurpose for your access. \\n\\n \\n\\uf0b7  Present valid identification, such as a passport or Real ID Act-compliant state driver\\'s license. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Present a completed copy of the SECNAV 5512/1 form to obtain your background check. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Upon completion of the background check, the Visitor Control Center representative will complete the \\n\\nDBIDS enrollment process, which includes your photo, finger prints, base restrictions, and several other \\nassessments; after all this is done, you will be provided with your new DBIDS credential. \\n \\nAll deliveries must pass through the base Truck Inspection Station.  All delivery vehicles are subject to inspection.  \\nDrivers should expect delays due to heightened security.   \\n\\nFor access to the main, perimeter gates at any Navy Base Kitsap installation, contractors are required to be a US \\nCitizen and have either: \\n \\n\\n                 (a) DBIDS badge or \\n                 (b) Request a One-day Visitor badge at Pass & ID.  Be prepared to present: \\n\\n-Photo ID  \\n-Original proof of citizenship (any one of the following is acceptable):   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nState Certified Birth Certificate (must have the raised seal)  \\nUnexpired U.S. passport/Passport Card \\nAlien Registration Card \\nEnhanced state-issued driver\\'s license only accepted from Michigan, Minnesota, New \\nYork, Vermont, and Washington. Real ID licenses are not accepted at this time. \\nNaturalization papers  \\nCertificate/Statement of Birth Born Abroad)  \\n\\n \\n \\n-Current vehicle registration and insurance \\n-Bill of lading that has the delivery address on it \\n\\n \\nPlease note:  The DBIDS badge does not give access through the second, Operational Area (OA) gate to lower base \\nBangor or to the Controlled Industrial Area (CIA) at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS).  To gain access to either \\nthe OA Gate or CIA area, a Navy Region Bangor or NAVSEA Badge is required. \\n \\nTo request a NAVY REGION NW badge, https://www.bavr.cnic.navy.mil/.

(Applies only if the contract value is \\nexpected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and \\nbelief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- \\n\\n(1) [ ___  ] Are, [ ___  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for \\nthe award of contracts by any Federal agency;  \\n\\n(2) [ ___  ] Have, [ ___  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil \\njudgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, \\nattempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal \\nor state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, \\nbribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax \\nlaws, or receiving stolen property;  \\n\\n(3) [ ___  ] Are, [ ___  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government \\nentity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and \\n\\n(4) [ ___  ] Have, [ ___  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent \\nFederal taxes in an amount that exceeds the threshold at 9.104-5(a)(2)for which the liability remains unsatisfied. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cSPMYM224Q0752 \\n \\nPage 41 of 73 \\n \\n\\n(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: \\n\\n(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not \\nfinally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the \\nliability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. \\n\\n(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax \\nliability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection \\naction is precluded. \\n\\n(ii) Examples. \\n\\n(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to \\nseek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. \\nShould the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all \\njudicial appeal rights. \\n\\n(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been \\nissued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals \\ncontesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the \\ncourse of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no \\nprior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the \\ntaxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal \\nrights. \\n\\n(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely \\npayments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is \\nnot currently required to make full payment. \\n\\n(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection \\naction is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). \\n\\n \\n \\n(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The \\nContracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are \\nincluded in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless \\nexcluded at 22.1503(b).]  \\n \\n(1) Listed end products. \\n \\n\\nListed end product \\n\\nListed countries of origin \\n\\n ___   \\n\\n ___   \\n\\n ___   \\n\\n ___   \\n\\n ___   \\n\\n ___   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies \\nthat it is not aware of any such use of child labor.  \\n \\n(j) Place of manufacture.

This UTV is required to have a cargo bed \\nthat will tilt to dump contents. Our team at the MLFO is expanding, and as a part of this expansion \\nadditional UTVs will significantly enhance our ability to accommodate the already growing workforce.  \\nThe Mt. Lewis Field Office monitors and inspects BLM-NV lands in the Battle Mountain District.  These \\nlands consist of mostly unmaintained roads and brush.  For the employees to effectively inspect the \\nlands, it requires a 4-wheel vehicle.  A traditional 4X4 truck does not have the maneuverability to travel \\ninto tight spaces and have sufficient space to turn around.  Employees travel to remote locations that \\ninvolve traversing rocky and possibly high-altitude areas with supplies and equipment.\\n\\nSee attached Specifications for Item details.  \\n\\nDelivery is F.O.B Destination, to include all fees and cost.

The liability is finally determined if it has \\n\\nbeen assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial \\nchallenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until \\nall judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.\\n\\n(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the \\n\\ntaxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not \\ndelinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.\\n\\n(ii) Examples.\\n\\n \\n\\n(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, \\n\\nwhich entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a \\ndelinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this \\nwill not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\\n\\n(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax \\n\\nliability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to \\nrequest a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the \\nTax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is \\nentitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to \\ncontest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the \\ntaxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all \\njudicial appeal rights.\\n\\n(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. \\n\\nThe taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The \\ntaxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.\\n\\n(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent \\n\\nbecause enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).\\n\\n(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order \\n\\n13126).

The Tonopah Field Office monitors and inspects BLM-NV lands in the Battle Mountain District.  These lands consist of mostly unmaintained roads and brush.  For the employees to effectively inspect the lands, it requires a 4-wheel vehicle.

Invoice Information: \\n \\nThe contractor shall utilize the electronic invoicing upon delivery of supplies indicated herein.  Invoice may be \\nsubmitted not more than one every two weeks.  Invoices must be submitted electronically using Wide Area Work \\nFlow (WAWF) – Receipt and Acceptance.  The contractor shall self-register at the web site: https://wawf.eb.mil.  \\nContractor training is available on the Internet at https://wawftraining.eb.mil. \\n \\nAdditional support can be accessed by calling the NAVY WAWF Assistance Line: 1-877-251-9293. \\n \\nSee clause 252.232-7006 for WAWF table. \\n \\n4.  Inspection Level: \\n \\nQA 4   7 days inspection \\n \\n5.  Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS): \\n \\nEffective 14 August 2017, NCACS credentials will no longer be accepted for base access.  Any new contractor, \\nvendor or supplier requesting base access will be required to obtain a Defense Biometric Identification System \\n(DBIDS) credential.  NCACS credentials will no longer be issued.  Only DBIDS credentials will be issued to ALL \\ncontractors, vendors and suppliers seeking base access AFTER 30 June 2017.  Defense Biometric Identification \\nSystem (DBIDS) increases installation security and communications by receiving frequent database updates on \\nchanges to personnel/credential status, law enforcement warrants, lost/stolen cards, and force protection conditions.  \\nThe system provides continuous vetting anytime the DBIDS card is scanned at an installation entry point.   \\n \\nIf you currently have a Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) card, the following is required to get a \\nDBIDS credential: \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Present your NCACS Card and a completed copy of the SECNAV FORM 5512/1 to the base Visitor \\n\\nControl Center (VCC) representative. \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  The VCC will pull up your information in the computer, ensuring all information is current and correct. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Once your information is validated, a temporary DBIDS credential is provided. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Your temporary credential will have an expiration date, prior to which you will need to obtain your \\n\\npermanent DBIDS credential (~ 180 days). \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  For each additional U.S. Navy installation to which you need access, the first time you visit you only need \\n\\nto bring your DBIDS credential and statement of purpose for base access when arriving at the Visitor Control \\nCenter. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cSPMYM224Q1010 \\n \\nPage 5 of 59 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  The representative will enter base access authorization and then you may proceed to work. \\n\\n \\nIf you do NOT have an NCACS Card, the following is required to obtain a DBIDS credential: \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Present a letter or official document from any government sponsoring organization that provides the \\n\\npurpose for your access. \\n\\n \\n\\uf0b7  Present valid identification, such as a passport or Real ID Act-compliant state driver\\'s license. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Present a completed copy of the SECNAV 5512/1 form to obtain your background check. \\n \\n\\uf0b7  Upon completion of the background check, the Visitor Control Center representative will complete the \\n\\nDBIDS enrollment process, which includes your photo, finger prints, base restrictions, and several other \\nassessments; after all this is done, you will be provided with your new DBIDS credential. \\n \\nAll deliveries must pass through the base Truck Inspection Station.  All delivery vehicles are subject to inspection.  \\nDrivers should expect delays due to heightened security.   \\n\\nFor access to the main, perimeter gates at any Navy Base Kitsap installation, contractors are required to be a US \\nCitizen and have either: \\n \\n\\n                 (a) DBIDS badge or \\n                 (b) Request a One-day Visitor badge at Pass & ID.  Be prepared to present: \\n\\n-Photo ID  \\n-Original proof of citizenship (any one of the following is acceptable):   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nState Certified Birth Certificate (must have the raised seal)  \\nUnexpired U.S. passport/Passport Card \\nAlien Registration Card \\nEnhanced state-issued driver\\'s license only accepted from Michigan, Minnesota, New \\nYork, Vermont, and Washington. Real ID licenses are not accepted at this time. \\nNaturalization papers  \\nCertificate/Statement of Birth Born Abroad)  \\n\\n \\n \\n-Current vehicle registration and insurance \\n-Bill of lading that has the delivery address on it \\n\\n \\nPlease note:  The DBIDS badge does not give access through the second, Operational Area (OA) gate to lower base \\nBangor or to the Controlled Industrial Area (CIA) at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS).  To gain access to either \\nthe OA Gate or CIA area, a Navy Region Bangor or NAVSEA Badge is required. \\n \\nTo request a NAVY REGION NW badge, https://www.bavr.cnic.navy.mil/.

In the \\ncourse of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no \\nprior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the \\ntaxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal \\nrights. \\n\\n(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely \\npayments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is \\nnot currently required to make full payment. \\n\\n(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection \\naction is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). \\n\\n \\n \\n(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The offeror certifies, to the \\nbest of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals–\\n\\n(1) □ Are, □ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or \\n\\ndeclared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;\\n\\n(2) □ Have, □ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or \\n\\nhad a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in \\nconnection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government \\ncontract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission \\nof offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of \\nrecords, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen \\nproperty;\\n\\n(3) □ Are, □ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a \\n\\nGovernment entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this \\nclause; and\\n\\nPage 34 of 47\\n\\n\\x0cElko District Cattle Guard \\n\\nIssuing Office: BLM-NV State Office\\nLocation: BLM-NV Elko Field Office\\nSolicitation Number: 140L3924Q0020\\n\\n(4) □ Have, □ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any \\n\\ndelinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds the threshold at 9.104-5(a)(2) for which the \\nliability remains unsatisfied.\\n\\n(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:\\n\\n(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has \\n\\nbeen assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial \\nchallenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until \\nall judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.\\n\\n(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the \\n\\ntaxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not \\ndelinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.\\n\\n(ii) Examples.\\n\\n \\n\\n(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, \\n\\nwhich entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a \\ndelinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this \\nwill not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\\n\\n(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax \\n\\nliability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to \\nrequest a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the \\nTax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is \\nentitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to \\ncontest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the \\ntaxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all \\njudicial appeal rights.\\n\\n(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. \\n\\nThe taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The \\ntaxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.\\n\\n(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent \\n\\nbecause enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).\\n\\n(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order \\n\\n13126).

An IPA is the first step in a process to identify potential privacy issues and mitigate privacy\\nrisks. The IPA asks basic questions to help components assess whether additional privacy protections may be\\nneeded in designing or implementing a project[10] to mitigate privacy risks, and whether compliance work may be\\nneeded. Upon review of the IPA, the OPCL determines whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) document\\nand/or SORN, or modifications thereto, are required. The Contractor shall provide adequate support to complete\\nthe applicable risk assessment and PIA document in a timely manner, and shall ensure that project management\\nplans and schedules include the IPA, PIA, and SORN (to the extent required) as milestones. Additional information\\non the privacy compliance process at DOJ, including IPAs, PIAs, and SORNs, is located on the DOJ OPCL\\nwebsite (https://dojnet.doj.gov/privacy/), including DOJ Order 0601, Privacy and Civil Liberties. The Privacy Impact\\nAssessment Guidance and Template outline the requirements and format for the PIA.\\n\\n(b) If the contract involves an IT system build or substantial development or changes to an IT system that may\\nrequire privacy risk assessment and documentation, the Contractor shall provide adequate support to DOJ to\\nensure DOJ can complete any required assessment, and IPA, PIA, SORN, or other supporting documentation to\\nsupport privacy compliance. The Contractor shall work with personnel from the program office, OPCL, the Office\\nof the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), and the Office of Records Management and Policy to ensure that the\\nprivacy assessments and documentation are kept on schedule, that the answers to questions in the documents are\\nthorough and complete, and that questions asked by the OPCL and other offices are answered in a timely fashion.\\nThe Contractor must ensure the completion of required PIAs and documentation of privacy controls consistent with\\nfederal law and standards, e.g. NIST 800-53, Rev. 5; and compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, E-Government\\nAct of 2002, Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, and key OMB guidelines, e.g., OMB Circular\\nA-130.\\n\\n \\n[1] “[T]he term ‘record’ means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an\\nagency, including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment\\nhistory and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the\\nindividual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.”  5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(4). “[T]he term ‘system of records’ means\\na group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or\\nby some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.”  5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5).\\n[2] As stated in FAR 52.224-3 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Managing Federal\\nInformation as a Strategic Resource (2016), “’personally identifiable information’ means information that can be used to\\ndistinguish or trace an individual\\'s identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable\\nto a specific individual.” Regarding “sensitive PII,” “[t]he sensitivity level of the PII will depend on the context, including\\nthe purpose for which the PII is created, collected, used, processed, stored, maintained, disseminated, disclosed, or\\ndisposed. For example, the sensitivity level of a list of individuals’ names may depend on the source of the information,\\nthe other information associated with the list, the intended use of the information, the ways in which the information will be\\nprocessed and shared, and the ability to access the information.” OMB Circular A-130, at App. II-2.\\n[3] The DOJ OPCL Resources page is available at https://www.justice.gov/opcl/resources.\\n[4] As stated in DOJ Instruction 0900, “Contractors must notify the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer’s\\nRepresentative, and JSOC (or component-level SOC) within 1 hour of discovering any incidents, including breaches,\\nconsistent with this Instruction, guidance issued by the CPCLO, NIST standards and guidelines, and the US-CERT\\nnotification guidelines.”\\n[5] https://www.justice.gov/file/4336/download\\n[6] As stated in DOJ Instruction 0900, the description should include the type of information that constitutes PII; purpose\\nfor which PII is collected, maintained, and used; extent to which PII identifies a peculiarly vulnerable population; the\\ndetermination of whether the information was properly encrypted or rendered partially or completely inaccessible by other\\nmeans; format of PII (e.g., whether PII was structured or unstructured); length of time PII was exposed; any evidence\\nconfirming that PII is being misused or that it was never accessed.\\n[7] As stated in DOJ Instruction 0900, the report should include the nature of the cyber threat (e.g., Advanced Persistent\\nThreat, Zero Day Threat, data exfiltration) for cyber incidents.\\n\\n\\x0c15B41624Q00000005 Page 25 of 31\\n\\n[8] As stated in DOJ Instruction 0900, the report should include analysis on whether the data is accessible, usable, and\\nintentionally targeted. \\n[9] As defined in 40 U.S.C. § 11101, the term “information technology” means any equipment or interconnected system\\nor subsystem of equipment, used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management,\\nmovement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the executive\\nagency, if the equipment is used by the executive agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with\\nthe executive agency that requires the use (i) of that equipment or (ii) of that equipment to a significant extent in the\\nperformance of a service or the furnishing of a product; includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging\\nperipherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to\\nbe controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including\\nsupport services), and related resources; but does not include any equipment acquired by a federal contractor incidental\\nto a federal contract.\\n[10] In this instance, the term “project” is used to scope the activities (e.g., creating, collecting, using, processing, storing,\\nmaintaining, disseminating, disclosing, or disposing of information) covered by an IPA. A project is intended to be\\ntechnology-neutral, and may include an information system, a digital service, an information technology, a combination\\nthereof, or some other activity that may create potential privacy issues or privacy risks that would benefit from an IPA. The\\nscope of a project covered by an IPA is discretionary, but components should work with their SCOP and OPCL.\\n \\n(End of Clause)\\n\\n52.243-1   Changes-Fixed-Price (Aug 1987)\\n\\n(a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes\\nwithin the general scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:\\n \\n(1) Drawings, designs, or specifications when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the\\nGovernment in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications.\\n \\n(2) Method of shipment or packing.\\n \\n(3) Place of delivery.\\n \\n(b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part\\nof the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable\\nadjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.\\n \\n(c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the\\nwritten order.

The liability is finally determined if it has \\n\\nbeen assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial \\nchallenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until \\nall judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.\\n\\n(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the \\n\\ntaxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not \\ndelinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.\\n\\n(ii) Examples.\\n\\n \\n\\n(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, \\n\\nwhich entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a \\ndelinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this \\nwill not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\\n\\n(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax \\n\\nliability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to \\nrequest a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the \\nTax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is \\nentitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to \\ncontest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the \\ntaxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all \\njudicial appeal rights.\\n\\n(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. \\n\\nThe taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The \\ntaxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.\\n\\n(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent \\n\\nbecause enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).\\n\\n(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order \\n\\n13126).
