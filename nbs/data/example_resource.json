Field \nspectroradiometry data will also be used for remote sensing algorithm development, satellite calibration and validation \npurposes. USGS employees will conduct these field research measurement activities with the spectroradiometer for \ncomparisons with international standards and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) material \ncharacterizations. Therefore, the field spectroradiometer must meet rigorous scientific analysis, scientific peer-reviewed \nstandards (i.e. Thompson et al., Quantifying uncertainty for remote spectroscopy of surface composition, Remote Sensing \nof Environment, 2020, 111898) and operational accuracy needs.  The field spectroradiometer must perform to within +/-\n1% of Landsat and other highly calibrated satellite mission data. \n \nThe procurement equipment supports scientific research, civil Earth Observation mission calibration and validation \nactivities on hydrologic, ecologic, atmospheric, mineral and radiative properties of the Earth. The procurement equipment \nbolsters the ability of the USGS to capture, process, monitor, record, calibrate, validate and distribute accurate, precise \nscientific data and records in a timely manner.  \n \nIn making this procurement decision, USGS considered alignment with DOI IT Transformation goals, alternative \nsolutions, bandwidth and IT security impacts, portability, interoperability and life cycle requirements.  \n \nSpecifications \n \nField spectroradiometer equal to or better than an ASD FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res NG Spectroradiometer is required with the \nfollowing salient characteristics: 350-2500nm spectral range with 3nm at 700nm, 6nm at 1400 & 2100 nm spectral \nresolution, 100 millisecond scanning, adjustable collection potential via integrated spectroradiometric software, 0.1 nm \nwavelength reproducibility, +/-0.1% radiometric signal repeatability from 350-2500nm, 1.5m hardwire connected cable \nwith 57 glass fibers identifiable across VNIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 detectors, NIST traceable manufacturer, instrument-\nspecific radiometrically corrected detachable 8 degree field-of-view fore optic, NIST traceable manufacturer, instrument-\nspecific radiometrically corrected detachable reflective cosine receptor, 5m underwater fiber optic removable jumper \ncable, underwater instrument-specific, radiometrically corrected RadCal removable remote cosine receptor, cuvette \naquatic sample holder assembly, coordinated Hi-Brite contact probe and Spectralon reference cap, portable NIST-grade \nspectrometer calibration illuminator lamp, integrating sphere, Mercury Argon NIST-grade calibration source, and a \n10\u201dx10\u201d Spectralon reference panel and instrument-specific wavelength calibration puck. The main spectrometer unit is \nunder 12lbs and operates for extended periods of time at temperatures ranging from 0\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 degrees Celsius. Desired \nfield spectroradiometer accessories also include: spare battery,  medium-duty tripod for spectrometer, and lightweight \ntripod for Spectralon panel.
