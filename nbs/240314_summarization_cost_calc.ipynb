      "indicates otherwise in the Schedule. The transportation rate will be based on a nominal size U.S. flag tanker of\n",
      "approximately 48,633 Deadweight Tons (DWTs). The transportation rate will be an estimated market rate based\n",
      "on either market information or published prices, or actual rates paid by the Government or any combination\n",

      "rate expressed in U.S. cents per gallon. This rate will then be added to the per gallon offered price to determine\n",

      "(1) The following procedures will be followed in applying transportation freight rates to offers in\n",

      "(i) 310,000barrels of product will be considered sufficient to fully utilize vessels 48,633\n",
