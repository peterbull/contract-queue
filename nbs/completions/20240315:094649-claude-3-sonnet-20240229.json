The project requires\nprofessional architectural and engineering services for the VA Medical Center in Loch Raven, MD.\nThis narrative will serve to provide an updated outline of the design direction to LRS Federal LLC\n(LRS) by the Veterans Administration for the mechanical, plumbing, fire protection, electrical,\narchitectural, and structural plans for the renewal of the digital radiography system in Room 01C\nof Building 6 at Loch Raven VA Medical Center.\nThe VA has selected a radiography equipment manufacturer, Carestream. Carestream, in\ncollaboration with the VA radiography team, has provided an updated room layout to\naccommodate the chosen radiography equipment and the needs of the VA as an end user. This\nupdated room layout is included in the drawing section of the design package for reference only.\nThe selected radiography equipment features the Carestream DRX-Evolution. This 100% design\nsubmission considers all the selected radiography equipment's mechanical, electrical, and\nstructural needs. The 100% design also specifies and includes the Handicare A625 patient lift per\nrequest by the VA.\nARCHITECTURAL\nThe existing ceiling tiles and grid will be removed to allow reconfiguration of the radiographic\nequipment area and auxiliary associated appurtenances for the new equipment to be installed.\nA new grid, ceiling tiles, and floor finishes will be installed to accommodate the equipment\ninstallation. Floor and wall finishes shall match the adjacent existing areas to remain.\nThe existing lavatory is to remain.\nA Handicare A625 patient lift will be added to the space per the request of the radiography team.\nSTRUCTURAL\nUpon removal of the ceiling in Radiographic Room 119, the existing equipment support rails shall\nrequire modification to accommodate the new equipment requirements for structural bracing\nfrom the existing structure.\n\n\fLoch Raven Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Radiography Room\nLoch Raven VAMC\nBaltimore, Maryland\nPage 2 of 4\n\nStructural models based on the existing drawings, site visit information, and selected equipment\nto apply the equipment load were utilized to verify deflection criteria and that the existing\nstructural support can accommodate the new equipment.\nBased on field visual observations, the existing roof framing consists of a roof metal deck\nsupported by light gauge steel trusses spanning between the existing bearing walls. Unistrut\nmembers anchored to the existing trusses support the current medical equipment. There are no\nsigns of any structural deficiencies noticed during the site visit.\nThe New Research Building is adjacent to the Radiography. Because of its proximity, it is\nreasonable to assume that information contained in its Geotechnical Engineering Study,\nspecifically, the modulus of subgrade reaction k of 75 pounds per cubic inch for the subgrade\nunderneath the slab-on-grade (SOG) for the New Research Building, can be used in the analysis\nof the SOG at the Radiography room.\nBased on the Technical Publication of Carestream DRX-Evolution, the VA\u2019s selected equipment,\nthe total equipment weight hung from the ceiling above is about 860 lbs. Assuming an additional\nUnistrut framing member weight of 800 lbs., the total weight hung from existing truss framing is\napproximately 1,660 lbs.\nBased on the Equipment Layout Drawing and the Stationary Ceiling Mounting Interface Diagram,\nthis weight will be distributed to a tributary area of about 140 square feet of the roof framing,\nequivalent to about 11.9 pounds per square foot. The amount of loading is not significant. Given\nthat the existing structure was designed for medical facilities and has been supporting existing\nequipment, the existing structure can support the Carestream DRX-Evolution.\nFurthermore, with the addition of the ceiling-mounted patient lift, Handicare A625, the rated\nweight of the patient lift will be anchored to the Unistrut system, which is anchored to the roof\ntrusses. The existing structure can support the patient lift and the Carestream DRX-Evolution\nequipment.\nThe contractor shall be required to coordinate with the equipment manufacturer of the selected\nequipment to modify the support framing as may be required.\nMECHANICAL\nIt is recommended that the existing mechanical air distribution and return air from the space be\nreconfigured, except as may be required by the structural support changes for the radiographic\nequipment in the ceiling, as well as electrical lighting and device relocation.\nA new return air register and the existing return register with associated ductwork transfer shall\nbe installed from the radiographic room space.\n\n\fLoch Raven Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Radiography Room\nLoch Raven VAMC\nBaltimore, Maryland\nPage 3 of 4\n\nThe existing variable air volume (VAV) unit above the ceiling will be replaced. A new VAV terminal\nunit with associated ductwork, reheat coil, piping, diffusers, and controls connected to the\nexisting BAS system will be installed.\nPiping serving the VAV unit for reheat will be re-piped to the new unit.\nThe HVAC systems serving the entire air handling unit zone system(s) shall be tested, rebalanced,\nand recommissioned to accommodate the radiographic equipment upon which the design is\nbased.\nPLUMBING\nThe existing sink located in the space shall be maintained on the existing wall line.\nFIRE PROTECTION\nThe existing fire protection piping and sprinkler heads in the space shall be maintained. Sprinkler\nhead locations shall be adjusted to accommodate the structural rail locations, HVAC return air\nregister, and supply diffusers, lighting fixtures, and associated electrical systems installed in the\nplane of the ceiling.\nELECTRICAL\nExisting General Electrical Conditions:\n\u2022 The existing Radiology Room 118 is located on the first floor of building 6. The electrical\npanel supplying the radiology room is on the same floor, in room 120 next door.\n\u2022 Electrical panel 3A is a 400-amp main breaker panel in room 120. It supplies power to the\n42 circuits, 100A, 208v, and 3-phase panel A in room 117. Panel A supplies a 60A main lug\nonly (MLO) sub-panel SPA in the radiology control area in room 118. Panel 3A is powered\nthrough a pad-mounted utility transformer outside the building with the CT cabinet and\npull box mounted on the outside wall of the main electric room.\n\u2022 The Subpanel located in the Control Area supplies power for receptacles, the new table,\nand the lift in the Radiology Room\nProposed New Electrical Work:\n\u2022 Disconnect power circuits and equipment fed from Panel 3A for existing radiology\nequipment being demolished and reused for new.\n\u2022 Disconnect circuits back from subpanel SPA for existing lighting and receptacles being\ndemolished and reuse for new.\n\n\fLoch Raven Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Radiography Room\nLoch Raven VAMC\nBaltimore, Maryland\nPage 4 of 4\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nSelect and locate new LED light fixtures for the radiology and control area and connect\nthem to existing panel A.\nProvide and install a new radiology main breaker and connect to existing Panel 3A after\nvendor Carestream has installed radiology equipment.\nReconnect the existing warning light and emergency off button.\nReuse existing light control occupancy sensors in the radiology room and control area.\nProvide data drop in control area.\nProvide power for the radiology table and patient lift.\n\nAttachments\nAttachment 1 - 100% Design Submission Drawings\nAttachment 2 - 100% Design Submission Budget Cost Estimate\nAttachment 3 - 100% Design Specifications\nAttachment 4 - Savaria Patient Lift\n            "
